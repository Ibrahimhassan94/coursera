# Deep-Learning-Coursera
This repository contains the programming assignments for Deep Learning specialization courses by Andrew Ng.
It deals with the following concepts.

DNNs-Deep Neural Networks, Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization, Optimization, CNNs-Convolutional Neural Networks(LeNet5, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Inception Network), Transfer Learning(Neural Style Transfer), RNNs (LSTM, GRU) and Structuring Machine Learning Projects.

Please refrain from using the codes to submit the assignments for the course. It is in violation of the principles of Coursera.
