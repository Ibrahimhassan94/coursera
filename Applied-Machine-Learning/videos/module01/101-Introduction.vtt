00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:13.059
Hi, and welcome to the applied machine
learning component of the University of

2
00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.620
Michigan's online course
in Applied Data Science.

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.890
My name is Kevin Collins-Thompson and I'm
an Associate Professor of Information and

4
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.560
Computer Science at
the University of Michigan.

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.430
I'll be your instructor for
this part of the course.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.130
I have about 20 years of research and
development experience in applying machine

7
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.610
learning to a wide variety of problems
in both academia and industry,

8
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.740
everything from language tutoring
software to commercial search engines.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.910
This is an incredibly exciting time to
be involved in machine learning, and

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330
I hope this part of
the course inspires you

11
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.720
to look more deeply into
this fascinating world.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.688
This week, you'll learn what machine
learning is and why it's important to data

13
00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:56.910
science, how machine learning is applied
to key problems in our information

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.900
economy, and how to set up your first
machine learning application in Python.

15
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.849
So what defines the field
of machine learning?

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.410
In a lot of cases when a computing
problem needs to be solved, for

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.230
example, storing and
retrieving data from a database,

18
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.210
the way we often address it is to write
a program that manually specifies

19
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.420
a series of programming steps that need to
be run to solve that particular problem.

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.480
This works great for

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.370
the vast number of computer science
problems that are out there.

22
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.380
However, not all problems lend
themselves to being solved

23
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.880
effectively by writing a handcrafted
program or set of rules.

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.630
For example, how would you write down a
set of rules in a programming language for

25
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.281
accurately converting
human speech to text?

26
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:47.721
A process known as speech recognition
which is now available on millions of

27
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:51.820
smart phones or used in customer
support systems all over the world.

28
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.080
Given how a subtle and complex human
speech is with the huge variety

29
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.310
of different pronunciations,
vocabulary, accents, and so forth.

30
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.560
Writing a set of program rules by hand

31
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.020
that could recognize portions
of an audio signal and

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.860
decide which words were in the signal and
so forth would be a gargantuan task.

33
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.840
And even then,
it would still likely be inflexible and

34
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.610
not very robust at recognizing
different types of speech.

35
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.700
Moreover, if we needed to customize the
system so it could recognize new words or

36
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.430
other features that we hadn't encoded in
our existing rules, we'd have to write

37
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.830
a whole new set of rules, which would
be a prohibitively difficult task.

38
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.220
Machine Learning, on the other hand,
gives us the technology that allows us to

39
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.230
automatically learn these complex rules
efficiently from labelled examples,

40
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.440
called, training data,
in a way that is much more accurate and

41
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.190
flexible than attempting to
program all the rules by hand.

42
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.670
Moreover, since it's unlikely any future
examples we see would match exactly what

43
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.380
was in the training set, a primary goal
of effective machine learning algorithms

44
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.930
is to be able to generalize,
to correctly predict or

45
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.460
recognize new objects that
weren't seen during training.

46
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.930
So the basic problem of machine learning
is to explore how computers can

47
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.790
program themselves to perform a task, and

48
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.830
to improve their performance automatically
as they gain more experience.

49
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.550
Now this experience can take the form of
data in a lot of different formats or

50
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.110
situations, such as labeled examples that
are used to train the system's initial

51
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.130
structure, like in email spam detection.

52
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.805
A system could get feedback from the user.

53
00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:40.325
For example, a search engine gets clicks
on the search page or a system could get

54
00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:42.895
data from the surrounding environment
that's gathered over time.

55
00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:46.645
For example, self-driving cars
that can detect nearby objects and

56
00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:49.335
events and learn to move more reliably.

57
00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:54.050
To accomplish this goal effectively and
efficiently,

58
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.630
Machine Learning draws heavily on
statistics and computer science.

59
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.490
The statistical methods give
machine learning algorithms

60
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.020
ways to infer conclusions from data and
to learn from data and

61
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.520
also to estimate how reliable
those conclusions are.

62
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.520
Computer science methods, on the other
hand, give machine learning algorithms

63
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.780
the computing power to solve problems,
including effective large scale

64
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.200
computational architectures and
algorithm for capturing, manipulating,

65
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.710
indexing, combining and
performing predictions with data.

66
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.680
Think about how quickly a commercial
search engine can match your query against

67
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.355
billions of web pages and almost
instantly return a set of useful results.

68
00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:42.003
That's an ideal illustration of
the power of combining statistical

69
00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:44.254
methods with computer science.

70
00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:47.971
There are also growing connections between
machine learning and other fields,

71
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:49.672
those that are really fascinating.

72
00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:53.348
For example the problem of how someone,
or an individual or

73
00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:58.423
a system can optimize their performance in
a given environment is also shared some

74
00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:03.370
what research that people have done in
biology on how organism forage for food.

75
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.480
It also connects to research in
economics in how optimal pricing and

76
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.220
market structures can be computed.

77
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.590
Even psychology, especially psychology
where we have models and factors of human

78
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.870
learning, and are using those to influence
the design in machine learning techniques.

79
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.480
So this evolving field of machine
learning really brings together insights

80
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.930
across multiple scientific fields,
and that's one of the things I find so

81
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.750
fascinating about it.

82
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.950
Machine Learning algorithms
are now involved in more and

83
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.590
more aspects of everyday life from what
you read and watch, to how you shop,

84
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.580
to who you meet and how you travel.

85
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.280
And here just a few examples,
for example, fraud detection.

86
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.080
Every time you buy something
using a credit card,

87
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.670
machine learning algorithms immediately
check your purchase to verify whether or

88
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.930
not this might be
a fraudulent transaction.

89
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.791
To do this, these algorithms look at
features of the current transaction that

90
00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:03.480
you have just made,
such as time location, and amount.

91
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.560
They make a prediction of whether
it's fraudulent or not based on

92
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.900
whether that purchase is consistent with
the features of your previous purchases.

93
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.850
The system also records any user feedback
on whether the transaction was in fact

94
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.440
fraudulent.

95
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.621
And it uses that feedback to make
better predictions in the future.

96
00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:25.998
Search and recommendation systems
are also a huge area of application for

97
00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:27.550
machine learning.

98
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.520
And in fact,

99
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.340
those machine learning algorithms are at
the heart of how commercial search engines

100
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.650
work, starting with the moment
you begin typing in a query.

101
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.580
So one algorithm might
monitor your keystrokes to

102
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.870
predict the best queries to auto
complete while you're typing.

103
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.090
And then once you've finished your query,

104
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.890
some other machine learning
algorithms will be applied

105
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.510
to determine the selection and ranking of
the webpages that you see for that query.

106
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.640
Still other machine learning algorithms
will determine which ads if any,

107
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.490
you see on the page, which related queries
the system suggests for you and so forth.

108
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.900
In addition,
search engines typically use data

109
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.460
about how you interact with the search
site, such as which pages you click,

110
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.250
how long you read the pages to
improve their future effectiveness.

111
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.840
In a similar way, movie recommendation
sites use machine learning algorithms

112
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.760
to model what you liked in your past
reviews based on your past reviews.

113
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.081
And your interaction
patterns with the site and

114
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:29.280
how your preferences relate
to those of other users.

115
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.640
And it uses this data to learn a model for
your personal taste

116
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.820
to hopefully give you better choices that
keep you more engaged with the site or

117
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.870
that lead you to make more
movie purchases over time.

118
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.610
And then finally a third
example area that's

119
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.820
really seen a significant improvement
in the past several years in terms of

120
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.670
recognition quality,
speech and image recognition.

121
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.970
So although researchers have been working
on speech and image recognition for

122
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.190
decades, recently the development
of increased computing power,

123
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.460
better algorithms including
the use of deep learning.

124
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.230
And vastly increased volumes of data
have all led to a significant jump

125
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.610
in accuracy and flexibility of recognition
algorithms in the last five years or so.

126
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.430
Now recognition technology
is reliable enough and

127
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.780
fast enough that it's used as
an essential feature of smartphones and

128
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.110
home devices that can act on
spoken commands or questions.

129
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.310
Computer vision and image recognition
can now give increasingly accurate

130
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.180
identification of objects and
actions in images or video.

131
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.090
Even for a while now, over 85% of
handwritten mail is sorted automatically

132
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.040
with very high accuracy by
the United States Postal Service.

133
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.450
There are very exciting advances in the
medical domain, where image recognition

134
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.740
algorithms are being developed to
classify cancer cells as malignant or

135
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.150
benign, estimate the best course
of personalized treatment or

136
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.210
to find hard to detect
tumors in medical images.

137
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.890
And of course, self-driving, or
autonomous vehicles make extensive use

138
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.750
of real time image recognition and video
processing, as well as other technologies,

139
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.080
such as reinforcement learning.

140
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.080
Now these examples only scratch
the surface of how machine

141
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.780
learning is being applied
in today's society.

142
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.740
And, we'll encounter and

143
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.910
work with some other examples during
the progression of this course.

144
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.320
The name of this course module is
actually Applied Machine Learning.

145
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.790
So, what does Applied part mean?

146
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.730
When we designed this data science series,
we felt there was a need for

147
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.640
a course that focused more
on how to properly apply and

148
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.984
interpret the results from machine
learning algorithms at a high level and

149
00:09:39.984 --> 00:09:43.840
less on the technical details of exactly
how these algorithms work internally.

150
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.084
There are a number of excellent existing
core machine learning courses that already

151
00:09:49.084 --> 00:09:51.480
provide that deeper level
of technical detail.

152
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.758
And that detailed knowledge isn't
always necessary to work with machine

153
00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:59.698
learning algorithms, and
to use them for specific applications.

154
00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:03.600
In fact, there is a very exciting
trend happening where ready to use

155
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.259
machine learning algorithms for
speech recognition, language translation,

156
00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:10.861
text classifications and many other tasks,

157
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:16.090
are now being offered as web based
services on cloud computing platforms.

158
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:21.580
Greatly increasing the audience of
developers that are able to use them and

159
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.480
making it easier than ever to put together
solutions that apply machine learning

160
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.010
at a high level.

161
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.385
The following book, Introduction
to Machine Learning with Python,

162
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:36.120
is not required to complete the course,
but we recommend it as an additional

163
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.560
resource that may be useful to you as
you progress and for later reference.

164
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.060
Like this course, the book focuses on
